My personal color themes from various apps.

#### Installation

First, if you want the most powerful experience, install [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font.

Then, copy _$THEME_.xccolortheme file to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` directory and restart Xcode. You should have the "_$THEME_" in your list of themes in preferences.
